## About
Simple React Validator is exactly as it sounds. We wanted to build a validator for react that had minimul configuration and felt nautural to use. It's configuration and usage is similar to the Laravel PHP framework and make validation as easy as one line.

## Usage
Open the `example.html` file for more usuage examples of the library.

## Rules
This is the list of all the rules you can validate form inputs against. When using multiple rules, seperate them with a pipe `|`. When adding options, append a colon to the rule and seperate options with commas. Examples: `'required|min:20|max:120'` and `'required|in:stu,stuart,stuyam'`
